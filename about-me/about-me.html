        <h2>moments that changed the way i see the world</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>when i was 9 or 10, a stranger saw me crying with my mum in a tim horton's. he brought me a cookie and said 'idk what made you upset, but i hope this makes things better.' it did, and now i take every chance i get to brighten people's days.</li>
            <li>when i was 14, my mum took me to volunteer at the senior's home she worked at. it was the first time i talked about life with people on their deathbeds. hearing a person's regrets when you both know it's too late to fix them is tough. i told myself that wouldn't be me.</li>
            <li>when i was ~16, my dad used a map to show me how the world really works. he told me about global events that would happen in the future, why they would happen, and why we would be told they happened. 9 years later, every single prediction has been scarily accurate. i realized that ignorance is bliss, but knowledge is power.</li>
            <li>when i was 20, i worked at a shoe outlet store. every few weeks, a guy named roger would come and buy our shoes in bulk so he could resell them at a profit. one day, he was telling me about his rich friend who owned lakehouses, private jets, and supercars. so i asked, 'how does he make all that money?' roger said something that struck a chord: 'he works no harder than you and i.' i think of those words often.</li>
            <li>when i was 22, i met up with some friends who i hadn't seen since high school. at one point that evening, i noticed that nothing had changed about them that whole time - same bad habits, same complaints, same situation. i realized that sometimes, the cost of growth is outgrowing people.</li>
            <li>recently, i had a moment when the mere thought of my loved ones made me emotional. i had never felt something like that, but it was almost like i was drowning in gratitude. i know how dumb that sounds. i feel like the luckiest guy in the world.</li>
